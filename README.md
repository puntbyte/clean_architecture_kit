# Clean Architecture Kit

A powerful and highly configurable linter toolkit for enforcing Clean Architecture principles in 
Dart & Flutter projects. It not only finds architectural violations but provides powerful quick 
fixes to generate your boilerplate for you.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Lints:** Enforce layer purity, dependency direction, naming conventions, and 
  more.
- üöÄ **Intelligent Code Generation:** Automatically generate complete `UseCase` classes from your 
  `Repository` interfaces with a single click.
- üì¶ **Works Out-of-the-Box:** Includes built-in base classes (`Repository`, `UseCase`, 
  `FutureEither`) for instant productivity.
- üîß **Highly Configurable:** Customize everything from folder names to class naming conventions 
  to fit your team's style guide.
- üèóÔ∏è **Future-Proof Design:** Built to be extensible for other architectural patterns in the 
  future.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Add `custom_lint` and `clean_architecture_kit` to your `dev_dependencies`.

```sh
dart pub add --dev custom_lint
dart pub add --dev clean_architecture_kit
```

### 2. Configuration

Create an `analysis_options.yaml` file in the root of your project and paste the full configuration 
below. This provides a comprehensive setup that works out-of-the-box with the included base classes.

### 3. Usage

You can now import the provided base classes directly from the kit and start coding. The linter 
will guide you.

**Example `auth_repository.dart`:**

```dart
// 1. Import the base classes provided by the kit.
import 'package:clean_architecture_kit/clean_architecture_kit.dart';
import 'package:my_app/features/auth/domain/entities/user.dart';

// 2. Extend the `Repository` base class.
abstract interface class AuthRepository extends Repository {
  // 3. The linter will now detect that this method is missing a use case!
  FutureEither<User> getUser(int id);
}
```

## Code Generation in Action

The killer feature of `clean_architecture_kit` is its ability to write your `UseCase` boilerplate 
for you.

When the `missing_use_case` lint detects a repository method without a corresponding use case, it 
will show an informational warning.

1.  Place your cursor on the method name (e.g., `getUser`).
2.  Trigger the quick fix menu (usually `Ctrl + .` or `Cmd + .`).
3.  Select **"Create use case for `getUser`"**.

The kit will instantly generate a new, fully correct, and formatted file.

## All Lint Rules

| Rule Name                                 | Purpose                                                                                         |

| `domain_layer_purity`                     | Ensures the domain layer does not depend on models or outer layers.                             |
| `data_source_purity`                      | Ensures data sources do not depend on domain entities.                                          |
| `presentation_layer_purity`               | Ensures presentation (Blocs/ViewModels) depends on use cases, not repositories.                 |
| `repository_implementation_purity`        | Ensures public repository methods return entities, not models.                                  |
| `disallow_flutter_imports_in_domain`      | Bans `package:flutter/...` imports in the domain layer.                                         |
| `disallow_flutter_types_in_domain`        | Bans the use of Flutter types (like `Color`) in domain layer signatures.                        |
| **Dependency & Structure Rules**          |                                                                                                 |
| `enforce_layer_independence`              | Enforces the dependency rule (dependencies must flow inwards).                                  |
| `enforce_abstract_data_source_dependency` | Ensures repository implementations depend on data source abstractions, not concretes.           |

| `enforce_custom_return_type`              | Ensures repository and use case methods return the configured type (e.g., `FutureEither`).      |
| `enforce_use_case_inheritance`            | Ensures use cases implement a configured base class.                                            |
